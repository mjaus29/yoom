## üìù Description

Welcome to Yoom! A feature-rich Zoom clone that supports video conferencing with multiple participants, screen sharing, meeting scheduling, and recording capabilities.

Video calling integration is typically perceived as complex and time-consuming, often requiring weeks or months of development. This project aimed to demonstrate how third-party tools like Stream can dramatically reduce development time while still delivering enterprise-grade functionality.

The goal of this project is building a fully functional Zoom clone that supports video meetings with advanced features in just a few hours.

It includes real-time video and audio streaming, meeting scheduling, recording options, and a responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.

**Technologies Used:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Clerk, Stream
